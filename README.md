JWT Server and Testing Guide
Welcome!
Welcome to my JWT (JSON Web Token) Server and Testing repository! Here, you'll find everything you need to set up a secure JWT server using FastAPI, complete with rigorous testing to ensure smooth operation. Whether you're a developer interested in security practices or a student learning about authentication mechanisms, this guide will help you get started with setting up your own JWT server.

What’s Inside?
jwt_server.py: The backbone of the JWT server. It manages RSA key generation, JWT creation, and validation.
test_jwt_server.py: This script ensures our server is robust and secure through a series of automated tests using pytest.

**Features at a Glance**
Robust JWT Authentication
How It Works: My /auth endpoint issues JWTs, with the option to generate expired tokens to test how the system handles them.
Why It Matters: Using RSA for signing ensures the tokens are secure and reliable gatekeepers.

**Trustworthy JSON Web Keys (JWK)**
Key Access: The /jwks endpoint provides a set of valid JSON Web Keys for anyone needing to validate JWTs issued by my server.
Keeping It Fresh: I automatically remove expired keys to ensure only the most current and secure set is available.

**Getting Started**
Installation
Dive right in with these simple steps:

bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pytest python-jose cryptography

Running the Show
To start the server, use:
bash
uvicorn jwt_server:app --reload

To run the tests, execute:
bash
pytest test_jwt_server.py

**Dive Into Testing**
Ensuring Every Key Turns
-I make sure every key generated is precisely managed—effective only within its designated timeframe.
Authentication Under the Microscope
-I meticulously test both valid and intentionally expired JWTs to ensure the server reacts appropriately under various scenarios.

**HTTP Done Right**
-I adhere strictly to the correct HTTP methods and ensure that the server responds with the right status codes, even when things don’t go as planned.

**JWKs—Only the Best**
-My tests confirm that only non-expired JWKs are included for validation, keeping your security tight.

**Test Suite: The Proof Is in the Testing**
Using pytest, I cover all functionalities, testing every function and endpoint to maintain our system’s integrity and efficiency.

**Documentation and Linting: Clean and Clear**
My code is not just functional; it's also a pleasure to read and easy to understand, thanks to well-thought-out comments and consistent styling.

**Conclusion**
This JWT server setup is not just about managing tokens; it's about ensuring every interaction is secure and efficient. This guide ensures you have all the tools you need to implement, run, and test a JWT server that stands up to real-world challenges.
